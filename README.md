I personally like to invest passively as well as plan out financial investments for the future. I use a lot of investment calculators in order to make attainable goals and plans, however even some of the most popular ones lack a few desirable features. One big feature that I would like to implement in this calculator which would differentiate it from other investment calcultors is the ability to have contributions increase or decrease. I want to include this feature because I assume my ability to invest will increase as I get older. Another reason why I decided to create this application, is because I find a lot of investment calculator UI's displeasing, furthermore with the use of states in react we can see a direct impact on investments plans without having to refresh the page.
